Approach:


Initially take two pointers, fast and slow. The fast pointer takes two steps ahead 
while the slow pointer will take a single step ahead for each iteration.
We know that if a cycle exists, fast and slow pointers will collide.
If the cycle does not exist, the fast pointer will move to NULL
Else, when both slow and fast pointer collides, it detects a cycle exists.
Take another pointer, say entry. Point to the very first of the linked list.
Move the slow and the entry pointer ahead by single steps until they collide. 
Once they collide we get the starting node of the linked list.
But why use another pointer, or xentry?

Letâ€™s say a slow pointer covers the L2 distance from the starting node of the cycle 
until it collides with a fast pointer. L1 is the distance traveled by the entry pointer 
to the starting node of the cycle. So, in total, the slow pointer covers the L1+L2 distance. 
We know that a fast pointer covers some steps more than a slow pointer. Therefore, we can 
say that a fast pointer will surely cover the L1+L2 distance. Plus, a fast pointer will 
cover more steps which will accumulate to nC length where C is the length of the cycle 
and n is the number of turns. Thus, the fast pointer covers the total length of L1+L2+nC. 

We know that the fast pointer travels twice the slow pointer. So this makes the equation to

2(L1+L2) = L1+L2+nC. This makes the equation to

L1+L2 = nC. Moving L2 to the right side

L1 = nC-L2 and this shows why the entry pointer and the slow pointer would collide.
